# US strikes Iran's nuclear facilities in dramatic escalation of Middle East crisis

The United States launched devastating airstrikes against three of Iran's most sensitive nuclear sites on Sunday, marking the most significant American military action on Iranian soil since the 1979 revolution and raising fears of a broader regional war.

The strikes, codenamed Operation Midnight Hammer, targeted the Fordow, Natanz and Isfahan facilities using an unprecedented deployment of seven B-2 stealth bombers flying from Missouri, supported by more than 125 aircraft. Pentagon officials said the bombers dropped 14 of the military's most powerful bunker-busting bombs, marking their first combat use.

**Donald Trump**, announcing the operation from the White House, declared it a "spectacular military success" and claimed Iran's nuclear enrichment capabilities had been "completely and totally obliterated". But the strikes have prompted international condemnation and fears that the US may have crossed a line that makes wider conflict inevitable.

The operation was coordinated closely with Israel, which has been engaged in an escalating air war with Iran since a surprise Israeli attack on 13 June. **Benjamin Netanyahu**, the Israeli prime minister, praised Trump's "bold decision", saying it would "change the history of the Middle East".

It is understood that the decision to strike followed months of escalating tensions, with Iran launching hundreds of missiles and drones at Israel in retaliation for earlier attacks. Sources close to the administration said Trump had grown convinced that diplomatic efforts had stalled after offering Iran a 60-day negotiation window in April.

Iranian officials condemned the attacks as a "barbaric violation" of international law. **Abbas Araghchi**, the foreign minister, warned of "everlasting consequences" and asserted Iran's right to retaliate. The country responded by launching approximately 20 ballistic missiles at Israel, injuring 16 people, while the Revolutionary Guard threatened US bases across the region.

The strikes have ignited fierce debate in Washington. Democratic lawmakers, including Representative **Jim Himes** and Senator **Adam Schiff**, accused Trump of bypassing Congress and violating constitutional requirements for military action. Republicans largely backed the operation, with House Speaker **Mike Johnson** defending it as a response to Iran's refusal to negotiate nuclear disarmament.

But even some within Trump's base expressed reservations about deeper US involvement. Vice-President **JD Vance** publicly stated the US had "no interest in boots on the ground" â€“ remarks that may reflect growing unease about the administration's Middle East strategy.

Internationally, the response has been mixed. Gulf Arab states expressed concern over the escalation, fearing disruption to energy exports that underpin their economies. Russia and China condemned the strikes, with Moscow calling them "irresponsible". European officials urged a return to negotiations, while the UN's nuclear watchdog scheduled an emergency meeting.

The operation followed what sources described as a breakdown in diplomatic efforts led by Trump's special envoy **Steve Witkoff**, who had engaged in five rounds of talks with Iranian officials. Reports suggest Trump accelerated the timeline after issuing what one official called "private ultimatums" to Tehran.

General **Dan Caine**, chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, described the mission as the largest B-2 strike in US history, with initial assessments indicating "extremely severe damage" to all three sites. Defence Secretary **Pete Hegseth** asserted that Iran's nuclear ambitions had been "devastated", though officials acknowledged a full damage assessment could take time.

Iran's Atomic Energy Organisation acknowledged damage to the targeted sites but claimed no radioactive material was present, saying key assets had been evacuated. Spokesman **Behrouz Kamalvandi** emphasised that Iran's nuclear knowledge "cannot be destroyed", hinting at the programme's resilience.

The strikes came despite US intelligence assessments, including a March statement by Director of National Intelligence **Tulsi Gabbard**, that Iran was not actively building a nuclear weapon. Critics argue this undermines the administration's justification for such dramatic action.

As the region braces for Iran's response, analysts warn of an "escalatory spiral" that could draw in other powers. Iran's options range from restrained diplomacy to targeting US bases or closing the Strait of Hormuz, a critical oil route through which a fifth of global petroleum passes.

The coming days will be critical in determining whether the strikes achieve their stated goal of curbing Iran's nuclear ambitions or ignite the wider war that many in the region have long feared. For now, the Middle East stands on the precipice, with the world watching Tehran's next move.
